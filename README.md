# HERC2
 The goal of this project is to find out which organism is closest to humans in regard to the ocular pigmentation gene sequence. The gene we will be looking at is the HERC2 gene, as it controls the expression of the OCA2 gene. The OCA2 gene codes for the P protein which is involved in the maturation of melanosomes. Melanosomes are the location in which melanin is created and stored.
After aquiring 11 organisms HERC2 gene sequences from NCBI, it will be put in a text file in mobaxterm, then aligned with MAFFT, then put into Iqtree, and lastly put into RStudio to generate a phylogentic tree. The ten organisms that were used to be put in the phylogenetic tree to be compared to the human HERC2 gene were:
cat
dog                      
northern whitecheeked gibbon
pig
pygmy chimpanzee
rabbit
siamang
silvery_gibbon
sumatran_orangutan, western_lowland_gorilla
