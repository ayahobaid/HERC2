# HERC2
 The goal of this project is to find out which organism is closeest to humans in regard to the pigmentation of the iris in the eye. The gene we will be looking at is the HERC2 gene, as it controls the expression of the OCA2 gene. The OCA2 gene codes for the P protein which is involved in the maturation of melanosomes. Melanosomes are the location in which melanin is created and stored.
After aquiring 11 organisms HERC2 gene sequences from NCBI, it will be put in a text file in mobaxterm, then aligned with MAFFT, then put into Iqtree, and lastly put into RStudio to generate a phylogentic tree.
