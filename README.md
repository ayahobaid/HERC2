# HERC2
 The goal of this project is to find out which organism is closeest to humans in regard to the pigmentation of the iris in the eye. The gene we will be looking at is the HERC2 gene, as it controls the expression of the OCA1 gene. The OCA1 gene codes for the P protein which is involved in the maturation of melanosomes. Melanosomes are the location in which melanin is created and stored.
